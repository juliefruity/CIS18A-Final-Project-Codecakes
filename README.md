Purpose of Program: Created by the company Pro-J, this program is designed specifically for the cupcake company, Codecakes, to provide a smooth, yet simple step-by-step menu program for customers and staff operation. This program is to provide a satisfying experience for the users as they have the ability to customize a delicious cupcake while being informative on flavors, prices, and reassuring deicions through a reciept.

Instructions: The entire "codecakespack" and "codecakespackend" folders/packages will be saved to the desktop. Using the Command Prompt, the first input will be "cd desktop" to access files on the desktop. (For information: inside the package "codecakespack", there is a file named "Codecakes.java" and inside the package "codecakesendpack", there is a file named "Closure.java". We want to compile both java files from their packages because "Codecakes.java" imports the package "codecakesendpack" when compiled, which includes "Closure.java"). The second input will be "javac codecakespack/Codecakes.java codecakesendpack/Closure.java". The third input will be "java codecakespack/Codecakes". The program will run, providing instructions to choose number-based decisions for three steps for flavor choices towards user's cupcake, ultimately providing a reciept and ending the program.

This repository includes: folders/packages: "codecakespack"(includes: Codecakes.java) & "codecakesendpack" (includes: Closure.java), .docx documentation of project description & pseudo-code, and README.md.
