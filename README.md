Purpose of Program: Created by the company Pro-J, this program is designed specifically for the cupcake company, Codecakes, to provide a smooth, yet simple step-by-step menu program for customers and staff operation. This program is to provide a satisfying experience for the users as they have the ability to customize a delicious cupcake while being informative on flavors, prices, and reassuring deicions through a reciept.

Instructions: "Codecakes.java" must be saved inside a folder/package named "codecakespack", and "Closure.java" must be saved inside a folder/package named "codecakesendpack", and both packages (seperately) must be saved on desktop. (Both packages are already included in this repository with their appropriate java files, but both java files are also saved in the main part of the repository as well if prefered to create new folders with the appropriate package names on desktop). Moving forward, using the Command Prompt, the first input will be "cd desktop" to access files on the desktop. The second input will be "javac codecakespack/Codecakes.java codecakesendpack/Closure.java" (for this step, we want to compile both java files from their packages because "Codecakes.java" imports the package "codecakesendpack" when compiled, which includes "Closure.java"). The third input will be "java codecakespack/Codecakes". The program will run, providing instructions to choose number-based decisions for three steps for flavor choices towards user's cupcake, ultimately providing a reciept and ending the program.

This repository main includes: java files "Codecakes.java" and "Closure.java", folders/packages: "codecakespack"(includes: Codecakes.java) & "codecakesendpack" (includes: Closure.java), .docx documentation of project description & pseudo-code, and README.md.
